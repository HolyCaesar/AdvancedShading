# AdvancedShading
Providing a real-time rendering performance for complex scenes when millions of active lights are used is a challenge in 3D video games. This program, dx12tiledrendering, is a C++-based program demonstrating the advantages of using the sophisticated tiled forward shading technique to handle millions of active lights in a complex scene. Two shading techniques (the standard shading technique and the deferred shading technique) are implemented and used to compare with the tiled forward shading technique's performance when a large number of lights are activated. A profiler is developed to visualize the performance benchmarks of each shading technique.
